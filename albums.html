	<ol>My 5 Favorite Albums Are as Follows
		<li>Rodeo : Travis Scott
			<p>One of Travis Scott's first albums, it's definetely my favorite of his, the beats and variation mid song
				in many of these songs make them very fun to listen to.</p>
		</li>
		<li>The Division Bell : Pink Floyd
			<p>Probably my favorite concept album of all time, Pink Floyd are known for how to naturally make songs flow
				into each other, which great instruments and vocals</p>
		</li>
		<li>MBDTF : Kanye West
			<p>Although Kanye West isn't a great human being, his music has always been top class in the hip hop
				industry, due to albums like these. Every single one of these songs are incredible,
				with great beats, lyrics and features.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>Circles: Mac Miller
			<p>Mac Miller's first post mortem album, published and finished by his producer. It was my introduction to
				Mac Miller. While it's generally a slower paced and sadder album, I really connected with
				it during the pandemic, I used to listen to it on repeat, it holds a special place in my heart.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>Mr. Morale and the big steppers: Kendrick Lamar
			<p>This was Kendrick's first album in a long time, and he knocked it out of the part, with great beats and
				music, but most all, it shows him coming to terms with his mental health issues, and he
				discusses different aspects of life seldom touched upon in the hip hop industry.
			</p>

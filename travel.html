		<dt>Singapore and Malaysia - 2016</dt>
		<dd>This was a while back but I distinctly remember a lot of interesting stuff in Singapore, such as Universal Studios, Gardens By the Bay, and shore side water show.</dd>
		<dt>Thailand- 2018</dt>
		<dd>Thailand is a really interesting country, with great food. I don't remember too much about this place.</dd>
		<dt>LA, Vegas, San Francisco- 2022</dt>
		<dd>I went here very recently during the beginning of winter break, it was really fun to explore the US as I haven't visited many of the places here. Freemont street in Vegas,
			The Grand Canyon in Nevada, and the golden gate bridge were the highlights.

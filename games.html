	<p>Video Games have been a big interest of mine for most of my life. While in college, due to the workload and other factors, I don't play them as much, but they still are a great
		distraction from whatever work I have. In fact, while making this website, I distracted myself too much in between with none other than video games.<br>
		Some of my favorite video games are as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li class="main_list">Ratchet and Clank, Tools of destruction
			<p>Although I've only finished the game twice, it hold a special place in my heart as one of my favorite and first proper games on the ps3. It's a remake of a classic
				series on the original playstation and ps2, and it still holds up today with its fun combat, story, exploration and music.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="main_list">
			Minecraft
			<p>This one isn't too surprising. Minecraft has been a big part of my life, and some of my fondest moments with friends came from playing together on our world, exploring and building together
				It's always been a great way for me to reconnect and talk to people who are a big part of my life, and it's music is spectacular.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li class="main_list">
			Call of Duty
			<p>I grouped all the call of duty games in one category, but not to devalue their importance but because I played and enjoyed a lot of them. Playing splitscreen on nuketown, terminal, and 
				other classic call of duty maps, with my friends, was something I used to look forward to every weekend. While I don't enjoy where series has gone since, during their golden age, every one of those games
				 had an incredible campaign, multiplayer and coop modes, and they contributed towards so many hours of fun for me.

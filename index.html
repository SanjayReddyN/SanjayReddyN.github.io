	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I was born on October 17th, 2003, in Bentonville, Arkansas. When I was 7, my family moved to Bangalore, India,
		where I lived until I came to college.
		<br>Fun Fact: I was actually supposed to stay in India for my undergrad, but my SAT score was good enough that
		my parents were fine with me going abroad.

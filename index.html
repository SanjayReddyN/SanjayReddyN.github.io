	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I was born on October 17th, 2003, in Bentonville, Arkansas. When I was 7, my family moved to Bangalore, India,
		where I lived until I came to college.
		<br>Fun Fact: I was actually supposed to stay in India for my undergrad, but my SAT score was good enough that
		my parents were fine with me going abroad.
	</p>
	<h3>
		My advice to international students applying to college
	</h3>
	<p>The things you consider important when applying, like the college's rank, don't matter as much as you think. When I was applying to colleges, I didn't consider stuff like location, social life, and 
		everything else that important, but now that I'm here, I'm glad I'm enjoying it so much. It's important to do your due diligence on otehr stuff college entails as well, rather than just education, cause
		 they can impact your life pretty considerably
